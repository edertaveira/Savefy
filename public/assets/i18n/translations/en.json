Bad thoughts, suicide, problems in which there is apparently no solution, God can intervene! A word, a prayer, it can save a life. <1> How does it work? </1> The user fulfills his intention (no need to himself indentification) and click on the send button, a unique prayer code will be generated and all registered intercessors on the platform will receive this and will intercede and send good messages, all of which can be accompanied by the user through the generated code. The user through the same code, can also later put a testimony, bearing other people. Such testimonials are published here and on social networks. <1> How to become an Intercessor? </1> At first, only people previously registered by us are the Intercessors, but we are studying a way to allow automatic registration, with a previous evaluation valuing the security of the platform.",
